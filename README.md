# RBpy

[Model Order Reduction (MOR)](](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction)) is a technique for reducing the computational complexity of mathematical models in numerical simulations.

RBPy is a fully data-driven Python module to construct reduced order basis, empirical interpolants and surrogate models from training data.

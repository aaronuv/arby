Arby is a fully data-driven Python module to construct surrogate models, reduced bases and empirical interpolants from training data.

This package implements a type of [Reduced Order Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction) technique for reducing the computational complexity of mathematical models in numerical simulations. This is done by building a surrogate model for the underlying model using only a training set of samples.

# Install
From PyPI repo
```bash
pip install arby
```
For the latest version, clone this repo locally and from inside do
```bash
pip install -e .
```
or instead
```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/aaronuv/arby
```
# Quick Usage

Suppose we have a set of real functions parametrized by a real number &lambda;. This set,
the **training set**, represents an underlying parametrized model f<sub>&lambda;</sub>(x)
with continuous dependency in &lambda;. Without a complete knowledge about f<sub>&lambda;</sub>(x),
we'd like to produce an accurate approximation to the ground truth only through access to the training set.

With Arby we can do this by building a **surrogate model**. For simplicity,
suppose a discretization of the parameter domain [`par_min`, `par_max`] with `Ntrain` samples
indexing the training set
```python
params = np.linspace(par_min, par_max, Ntrain)
```
and a discretization of the x domain [a,b] in `Nsamples` points
```python
x_samples = np.linspace(a, b, Nsamples)
```
Next, we build a training set
```python
training_set = [f(par, x_samples) for par in params]
```
that has shape (`Ntrain`,`Nsamples`).

Finally, we build the surrogate model by executing:
```python
from arby import ReducedOrderModel as ROM
f_model = ROM(training_set=training_set,
              physical_points=x_samples,
              parameter_points=params)
```
With `f_model` we get function samples for any parameter `par` in the
interval [`par_min`, `par_max`] simply by calling it:
```python
f_model_at_par = f_model.surrogate(par)
plt.plot(x_samples, f_model_at_par)
plt.show()
```
